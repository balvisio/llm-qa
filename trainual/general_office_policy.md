# How to add PTO, Sick Time, and Personal Time to your Clarizen calendar

## Why is this important?

This is important because BioTeam (and Clarizen) needs to know how many days you actually work, for a couple of reasons. The time you are available to work plus your time off (PTO, sick, and personal time) equals your overall capacity for work. We use your capacity to set the number of hours you need to be billable to reach your billable target. If you take time off, your capacity for work goes down, and therefore the number of hours needed to reach your billable target goes down as well. The second reason this is important is that Clarizen does its own project forecasting, and similarly, it needs to know when you are working and not working. 

# Written Instructions
Login to Clarizen

Look for your username at the top right corner

Pull down on your username and look for “My Details” link

Now you have to extend the details page by clicking on the “More info” link in the middle of the page

Look for the section called “Personal Details” your calendar link will be right there with a small “Edit” link

Click on the edit link under Calendar, Under Personal Details inside the My Details page for yourself in Clarizen

When the calendar pops up press the button “Add Exception”

Add an exception for all the hours/days you are on PTO (the “Name” is any description, like “Vacation”)

Clarizen will block those days/hours out on your timecard AND it will adjust your resource load, tasks and all the other data reporting things that BioTeam uses to run reports and charts

# Company Headshot for Our Website

## Instructions for Company Website Headshot
BioTeam features everyone's picture on the team page on our Website and as profile pictures throughout our systems (like Zoom).

To help us provide a more professional look, we would like to have all of the pictures be professional headshots. Our business is our people, and we will continue to highlight the team.

## Budget and Payment
To assist with this initiative, BioTeam will pay for professional headshots for everyone who wants a new one or doesn't already have one. If you already have professional headshots that you like, you are welcome to keep them as-is.

Everyone's maximum budget is $200 for the headshots. Please put the charge on your company credit card (or a personal credit card) and then forward the receipt to accounts.payable@bioteam.net (the expenses do not need to be logged in Concur).

# Guidelines For Your Headshot and Posting Instructions
1.     Please wear clothing that adheres to our dress code:
2.     Headshots can be indoors or outdoors. We currently have a mix of these on the website. Given the pandemic, outdoors may be a better choice (if it isn't too cold).
3.     Please let Alicia Hosey (alicia@bioteam.net) know that you are working on getting your headshot completed.
4.  Once your photography session is completed and you have selected your photo, please forward the file containing your headshot to Alicia.

# Time Keeping for Support Staff Team Members

## Time Keeping in BambooHR for Support Team Members

As of April 1st, 2021, all non-consulting (Support) team members will report actual time worked in BambooHR on a daily basis. This record of your actual time worked on daily basis will help the Executive Leadership Team to understand how many hours you are working without recording individual projects that may be too numerous to track. Knowing this information will help us make sure you have a balanced workload so we can help when you don’t. In addition, this will serve as an attendance record for legal compliance requirements.


# How to Enter Your Time and the Timesheet Tab
All Support team members will have an area on the Home screen of BambooHR where they may record actual hours worked per day on a daily basis. 

You can also manage your time on the new Timesheet tab available under My Info.

The right side of the Timesheet tab will show you a summary of how many hours you have worked each day of the current week, the total hours you have worked during the week, and the total number of hours worked during the current pay period, including the number of hours for holiday pay, sick time and time off.

The green bars shown on future days indicate the number of hours you worked on that day last week

You can also see at the bottom of the summary when the timesheet will be submitted for approval

You can also view previous time periods here on the Timesheet tab

## Updating Your Time Sheet
The Timesheet Tab is also where you can make any edits to your timesheet if needed. Simply click into the box, make the needed adjustment, and click “Save.” You can make changes to your timesheet until it has been approved. Time will be recorded throughout the pay period and submitted to Finance at the end of the month. If you forget to log your time, you will still be able to enter it until the timesheet has been approved

## Time Off
It is expected that each team member will record actual time worked each day unless you are on Vacation, Personal or Sick Leave from the company. BambooHR will record all forms of leave automatically in your timesheet so this time does need to be recorded by you in your timesheet.

Please make sure that time off requests are submitted and approved through BambooHR by your Manager in order to have this time appear on your timesheet.

## Time Sheet Approval
At the end of each pay period (monthly) Finance with approve all Support Staff timesheets.

## Where to get assistance
If you need help with your timesheet or entry of time, please contact Kimberly at Kimberly@BioTeam.net or Mark Donald at Mark@BioTeam.net.
